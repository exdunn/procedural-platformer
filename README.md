A fantasy, multiplayer online battle arena game.  Combat is fast-pace the objective is to be the last contestant standing. 
Eliminate your enemies with destructive magic by reducing their health to 0.  A clean hit will knock the target back and
knocking them off the map will result in a instant kill.  Players can create "spell bars" by navigating to the Athenaeum menu
and selecting four unique abilities.  To play the game, either create or join a lobby and then wait for the host to start the
game.
